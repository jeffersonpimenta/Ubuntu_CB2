# Ubuntu_CB2
A image of Ubuntu 14.04 for use in you CubieBoard2


A file can be downloaded in the link: https://mega.nz/#!yKAxTAhJ!NYe5U4JY-QuDYA685x5cyuPBQP1L2TGJQJD_CYswN6U

I used the followed links to generate the file:
https://www.paulotrentin.com.br/cubieboard-2/ubuntu14-04-server-no-cubieboard-2/
http://www.cubieforums.com/index.php/topic,2835.0.html

The credentials is
-user: root
-pass: cubie

-user: cubie
-pass: cubie

Once connected via ssh, use cubie as user and cubie as pass and then use the command "su" for switch for root


By default i only install openssh, create the user cubie and setup led activity

Enjoy!
